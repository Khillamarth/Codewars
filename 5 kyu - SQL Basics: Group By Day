There is an events table used to track different key activities taken on a website. For this task you need to filter the name field to only show "trained" events. Events should be grouped by the day they happened and counted. The description field is used to distinguish which items the events happened on.

"events" Table Schema
id
name (String)
created_at (DateTime)
description (String)

The expected results is provided so that you can see what the expected output is supposed to look like. Your "actual" output needs to match the expected output.



ALTER TABLE events
ALTER COLUMN created_at TYPE DATE;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, created_at AS day, description FROM events
WHERE name ilike '%trained%'
GROUP BY created_at, description
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
