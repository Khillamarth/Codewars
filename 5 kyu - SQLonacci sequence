Yes it's Fibonacci yet again ! But this time it's SQL.

You need to create a select statement which will produce first 90 Fibonnacci numbers. The column name is - number

Fibbonaccii sequence is:

 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..., 89, 144, 233, 377, ...
where

f(0) = 0
f(1) = 1
...
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
Have fun!



WITH recursive f AS (
    SELECT 0::bigint AS a, 1::bigint AS b
    UNION ALL
    SELECT b, a+b FROM f
) SELECT a AS number FROM f
LIMIT 90;
